# Broodmother

Heavily inspired by the Origins++ Broodmother, I have put more emphasis on her ability to summon and use spiders to her advantage. You still summon three little spider minions to help you, but now they attack the enemies that hit you, or that you hit. Additionally, activating the "Come Children!" power again will re-summon them at your position, effectively allowing you to always have some help. Other spiders in the world will also come to your aid.

**Positive**
- Climb: You are able to climb blocks [Toggleable].
- Feed: Feed on enemies trapped in your web by hitting them with an empty hand.
- Entrapment: Trap all nearby foes in web for a short time.
- Poison Immunity: You are immune to poison.
- Dripping Venom: You poison enemies you hit.
- Spider Kinship: You and all nearby players become friends of the spiders, they will come to your aid.
- Come Children!: You have three children who will help you fight. They're not the smartest bunch, but you love them anyway.
- Web Shot:fire webs at the target. (This aggros your children to the hit monster.)
- Master of Webs: You navigate cobweb perfectly, and are able to climb in them. When you hit an enemy, they get stuck in cobweb for a while. Non-arthropods stuck in cobweb will be sensed by you. You are able to craft cobweb from string.
- Spiders Pour Forth: Upon your death, your arachnid children pour from your body, restoring some of your health and joining your legion.

**Neutral**
- Homely Mineshaft: You spawn in a Mineshaft.

**Negative**
- Pierce Weakness: Arrows are more easily able to pierce your carapace, doing more damage.
- Arthropod: Take extra damage from Bane of Arthropods enchanted weapons. (Hidden)
- Too Many Legs: You deal significantly less damage with **melee** weapons.
- No Shield: You cannot use a shield.
